        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div id="about-me">
        <p>Welcome to my coding journey! My name is Liam McWilliams, and I am a beginner coder currently taking Codecademy classes from Ann Arbor, Michigan.
            I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it presents. <br><br> However, it wasn't until recently that I decided to take a leap and start learning how to code. Codecademy has been an incredible resource in helping me get started on this exciting path. 
            As a beginner, I understand the challenges that come with learning to code. However, I am committed to pushing myself and expanding my knowledge and skillset. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and what projects I will be able to create in the future.
            Through this website, I hope to share my experiences, challenges, and successes with fellow coders, both beginners and experts alike. <br><br> I believe that the coding community is a collaborative and supportive one, and I am eager to be a part of it.
            Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon!</p>
